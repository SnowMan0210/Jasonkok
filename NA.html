              <h1>The Crimate Change</h1>
              <p>News about the climate crisis and the consequences if no action is taken will lead to climate change for example：<br>
                The global surface temperature rises together with greenhouse gas concentrations. <br>
                The warmest decade on record was from 2011 to 2020. Every decade since the 1980s has been warmer than the one before it. <br>
                There are more hot days and heat waves in almost all land locations. Higher temperatures exacerbate heat-related ailments and <br>
                make it more challenging to work outside. When the weather is hotter,wildfires start more easily and spread more quickly.<br>
                The Arctic has warmed at least twice as quickly as the rest of the world.<br>
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                In many areas, destructive storms have increased in ferocity and frequency. <br>
                More moisture evaporates as temperatures rise, <br>
                aggravating extremely heavy rains and flooding and resulting in more severe storms. <br>
                The warming ocean has an impact on both the intensity and frequency of tropical storms.<br>
                Warm ocean surface waters are the primary food source for cyclones, hurricanes, and typhoons. <br>
                These storms frequently demolish homes and towns, <br>
                resulting in fatalities and significant financial losses.<br>
